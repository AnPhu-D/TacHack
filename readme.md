# What is TacHack?
TacHack is a penetration testing tool that was built in May of 2023 to aid in testing ROBLOX games for remote event exploitability. It was very common for exploiters to maliciously and arbitrarily execute remote events to gain an unfair advantage in many ROBLOX experiences. TacHack can emulate the remote event execution behavior of the tools these exploiters use to explore vulnerable pathways in a developer's experience.

# How can I use TacHack?
